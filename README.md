# 2dParticleAnim

A very simplistic demo with the behavior of collisions in 2D between 2 particles and the limits of the screen.
Both particles are spawned with initial velocity and directions.
The main loop of collision detection is scheduled at an arbitrary rate of 30 frames per second to be visibly acceptable.
When the particles collide I launch a keyframe animation of the color change of the particles.
Basically, the demo mimics the behavior of spriteKit or cocos2d.
